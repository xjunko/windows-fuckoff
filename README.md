# windows grub fuckery

fixes the dumb "error: file '/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi' not found"

## why

for uni and work reasons, i still have to use windows for certain applications.
even though i am on IoT version of the windows, i still get updates like fuck and that,
somehow, broke the bootloader.

## how

this fix stems from [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1271907/dualboot-ubuntu-windows-error-file-efi-microsoft-boot-bootmgfw-efi-not-fou), i dont claim ownership of the thing.
just making it easier for me to find the fix anytime the shit is broken again.
